    <h1>Divs&spans</h1>
    <p>I'm going to teach you all about Divs&spans. First, the important both:</p>
    <h2 class="important">What is the divs and spans</h2>
    <p class="important">Classes are useful for applying styles to parts of a page, but sometimes you have a style that you want to apply to an entire part of your page, and adding a class to every tag can be unwieldy. It can also result in an HTML file that is difficult to read. Here's a new page I made about wildcats.</p>
    <p class="important">Here are some types of classes:</p>
    <ul class="important">
      <li>Divs</li>
      <li>Spans</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="important">
    <h2>We can simplify this using the new tag, div:</h2>
    <p> See all of the classes we had to add to make certain elements important and unimportant? We can simplify this using the new tag, div.</p>
    <p>Now, for some important for dive.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Then we can style entire sections of the page using the selectors:</p>
    <div class="unimportant">
    <h2>Important and .unimportant in our CSS:.</h2>
    <p>The div tag does not actually do anything on its own - it simply defines a section of a page. It acts as a container to separate the content of a page, so that when used with CSS, styles can be applied to an entire section.</p>
    <h2>Remember:</h2>
    <p>good code is code that is easy to change: When we use divs and want to change a class name, we only need to change one div instead of all of the elements inside of it.</p>
    </div>
